# General code design principles

## Repetition in code and the rule of three 

the programmer always strive to have a clean and clear code so when anyone try to read it will understand it quickly. Therefore,we always avoid things that will turn our code less understanding, repetition is one of the reason that can turn our code a less understanding code. Repetition is when our code repeat it-self so building of the program will take sometime. When we try to look for a solution for the repetition there are the rule of three different. it states that when we have a duplicate in our code, we need to refactor the code by adding abstract function.

## "You aren't gonna need it" and make the minimum viable product
If we need to have a clear and clean code, the programmers should not add any other unneeded functionality until it is necessary and that what it means with "You aren't gonna need it". And that gets us to more important definition and that is minimum viable product.

minimum viable product is when the we have a product with a minimum features and can also provide the required functionality, for these purposes:
* test the product with minimal resources.
* increase the learning.
* decrease wasted engineering hours.
* get the final product to the customer faster.
