## Ethics in the workplace
As a developers we are the last line of wrong doing things as for example the websites is one of the advertisment tools that is used nowadays and could do a huge impact in our society that it can save peoples or kill others. For example we can make a site that can prescribe a medication that is good and in the same time can advertise a drug who can kill others so we should add our ethics sometimes first.


## Ethics in Technology

For the upcoming years there will appear many technology that will affect our life such as cars that control by itself, IOT houses, and many other things but the thing that these things can sometime become harmful if we depend on them so much that they can take control of our life.
