# Inheritance and Interfaces

## Review for object and class

### What Is an Object?

 Software Object is like a real-life object such like a book who has properties like words and lines and uses or behaviors like it is used for reading. Also, the object when created we can add methods and properties. the uses for objects in programming adds more advantages such as:-

 1. Modularity
 2. Hiding the information.
 3. allow re-using the code .
 4. more easier in debugging and plugging.

 ### What Is a Class?

 as we said the object is like a real-life object, so we can say the book object for example does not all books have the same features some has smaller paper others are written in different languages. also the object when we create an instance of this object who has a different properties and method of from the object and we call it class and we call it blueprint.

 Every class has at least one of these:
 
 * methods
 * constructors
 * properties
 * Passing Information to a Method or a Constructor

 ## Inheritance

 As we know from before, the class is subclass from the object it self so it takes it's properties and methods. Hence, from this idea we can deduce that we can create from the same class whose a subclass from the object itself a new subclass and the class that was created from it the new subclass becomes called superclass. And, that is the definition of the inheritance.

 ### The Java class Hierarchy

 As we can see below, like for every topic there are sub topic or header also in the object and classes there are one object and then class and then subclasses and subclasses for the sub classes and so on... etc.

 ### subclass and superclass

 The subclass can inherit from the superclass any public or  protected variable/method. However, the private variables/methods can't be inherited from the superclass. the inherited members can replace,hide or supplement them with new members.

## Interfaces
An interface is like a blueprint of a class that contains the declarations and an abstract of the methods that is in class but not not methods body. The advantage of interfaces is to provide easier inheritance and an abstraction to the class.
