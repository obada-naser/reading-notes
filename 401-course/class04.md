# OOP

## Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

### What Is an Object?

 Software Object is like a real-life object such like a book who has properties like words and lines and uses or behaviors like it is used for reading. Also, the object who when created we can add methods and properties. the uses for objects in programming adds more advantages such as:-

 1. Modularity
 2. Hiding the information.
 3. allow re-using the code .
 4. more easier in debugging and plugging.

 ### What Is a Class?

 as we said the object is like a real-life object, so we can say the book object for example does not all books have the same features some has smaller paper others are written in different languages. also the object when we create an instance of this object who has a different properties and method of from the object and we call it class and we call it blueprint.

 Every class has at least one of these:
 
 * methods
 * constructors
 * properties
 * Passing Information to a Method or a Constructor

 ## Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers

 ### Decimals
 The decimals is a position of the numbers and we can call it position point. And we can say this is just a way to write the numbers. Also, we can regard the decimals is a base 10 system.
 like for example 20.45
 * 2: it is in tens position.
 * 0: it is in ones position.
 * 4: it is in tenths position.
 * 5: it is in hundredths position.
 and etc ..

 ### Binary Numbers
 It is a base 2 system and contains only 0s and 1s. The counting here is by increasing 1 the left number. And basically we use this system in computers. for example of binary system:  010010101 .

 ### Hexadecimal Numbers

 It looks like the decimal but after number 9 it starts using letter like ("A',"B","C","D","E","F") and that shows numbers from 10 to 15. Therefore, it is a 16 different values.


 ## what I learned 

 I learned that we have a class and objects in programming and how we can use them. Also, there is a different system of numbers aside the decimals like binary and hexadecimals.
