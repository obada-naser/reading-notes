# Amazon S3

From one of the services that is provided by aws S3 or the Amazon Simple Storage Service. This service provides an efficient object storage that is useful in many applications storing large amount of data and provides many features I will mention all of these features here.


## Features of S3

* Storage classes: It provides a classes for accessing the data.
* Management storage: S3 provides a management for the storage such as managed costs as called S3 Lifecycle ,Object lock that prevents data from deleting, and prevents any copy for the data.
* Managing the access: Amazon S3 controls the access for the data that not any one can reach the data by using bucket policies,AWS identity, Access list, Access analyzer.. .
* Process the data: And that is done by transforming the data, and by using event notifications it can trigger other services that uses S3.
* Monitoring the data: there are two methods to mointor the resources of being used for the S3 service first is automated like cloudwatch and cloud trail. the other one is manual monitoring. 

## How it works

It Works by using something called the bucket that as we know every S3 is an object and the bucket is a file that contains objects who is uploaded .To get each object from the bucket we use the key. Also we can retrieve the updated or deleted data we use the S3 versioning. And there are many different features in it like AWS identity.

The biggest advantage for this service that it provides a long term data stored or data consistency. and also can be read wor written over it.
