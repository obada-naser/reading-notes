# Java Basics


## Language Basics

The basics of java are these four:

* **Variables** : Here we will discuss the variable naming rules and conventions and the basic data types such as : primitive types, character strings, and arrays, default values, and literals.

* **Operators**: Operators are special symbols that perform specific operations on one, two, or three operands, and then return a result. There are high precedence and low precedence for operators like multiplicative and additive.

* **Expressions, Statements, and Blocks**:  Expressions are the core components of statements but statements may be grouped into blocks.

* **Control Flow Statements**: The statements of the code usually executed from top to bottom. However, using control flow statements break up the flow of execution by employing decision making, looping, and branching, enabling your program to conditionally execute particular blocks of code.

## compiling the code

Human being does not understand computer language that is 1's and 0's however he can understand the spoken language or programming language so to be able to speak with each other the compiler transits the programming language into a computer language and that what it means compiling the code.

## Java Documentation

Java has a standard Application Programming Interface â€”a huge library consisting of over 4,000 classes, each with its own functionality, its own limitations, and its own rules for effective use. There are two ways of searching a term using the Java documentation as for example searching a specific method like println method.

 1. Using the index method

 2. Using the list of classes method

 and by following one of the previous methods you can search any class and methods from the huge library and it can help anyone to understand any block of code that is written.
