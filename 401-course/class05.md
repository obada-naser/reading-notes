# Implementation: Linked Lists

## Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency

Big (O) is what shows the efficiency or the worst case efficiency of algorithms and it is based on two factors:-

1. Running time or the time complexity.
2. Memory space or the space complexity.

and in order to analyze these factors we use these 4 keys:

* **Input Size:** it is the size of the parameters that we read by the algorithm.  We always use letter (n) to refer to it. 

* **Units of Measurement:** to evaluate the time we consider the time in milliseconds, number of operations executed, and the number of basic operations. Also, to evaluate the space we consider what it needs to hold the number of code for the algorithm, the input data, and the output data.


* **Orders of Growth:** input size (n) used to determine the overall efficiency and units of space and time so as it increases the order of growth increases and that show the increase of time running or memory space. in the below chart we can see the difference of growth space.

* **Worst Case, Best Case, Average Case:** as we know the big (O) shows the worst case however, we can see that also the best and average cases.

## What is a Linked List?

A linked list is used in structuring the data and pointing or linking the nodes inside it. Also, we have two types of linked lists the first one is called singly that it references to the next node and the other one is called doubly and it meant to  reference the next and previous node. 

### Traversal
when we need to traverse a list of nodes in the singly linked list, we use the Next value and for looping we use the while loop and to tell where we are we use current variable.

### Adding a Node

when we want to try add a new node normally we will face a problems. like replacing the Head of the nodes with the new node. so there are steps to be able to solve this problem. 

    
## More information about linked list
from before we know that linked lists contains nodes and used to structure our code. However, they are also linear data structures and that means they are an arranged list.

### Memory management

the difference between the linked lists and arrays is the way they uses the memory of our machines. Also, deleting and inserting using the linked list is faster and with having a dynamic memory size and that is why that linked list is superior above the array.

## what I learned
I learned that we have the big O for time and space complexity. And the linked lists, what are they,how they works, and what they differs from the array.
