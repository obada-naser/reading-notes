# Arrays, Loops, Imports

## Packages and Import

we can group java classes together to become a packages.A package name is the same as the directory (folder) name which contains the .java files.

### Package declaration

To import java package into a class, we need to use java import keyword which is used to access package and its classes into the java program. Use import to access built-in and user-defined packages into your java source file so that your class can refer to a class that is in another package by directly using its name.

### Package declaration syntax

The order of declaration syntax:

1. Package statment (optional).
2. Imports (optional).
3. Class or interface definitions.

### Imports: three options

* import javax.swing.*;
* import javax.swing.JOptionPane;
* javax.swing.JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Hi");
