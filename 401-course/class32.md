# Serverless and Amplify

## Serverless architecture
Every company or hospital or any organization should have a system to be able to organize it's employee. One part of the system is such an important component and that is the server because it can to store the information.

 The server is a computer device who can store many data but however it has many problems like when the size of the company gets bigger or some of the data maybe lost so its fixing cost increases and the server itself is costly. Therefore many companies introduced the serverless solution and it is the ability to have a server but not in local but cloudily and you can use it by paying not high rent also you can have unlimited size.

 ### Cloud providers
 When we say about the most famous in serverless field or clouding providers we have these companies:

 * IBM openwhisk
 * AWS Lambda
 * Azure Functions
 * Alibaba Function Compute

 And many other companies that can provide this service. Here

 ### serverless VS server   

 1. Pricing :serverless reduces cost unlike traditional server.
 2. Networking: the serverless needs a gateway to get to it so an IP address.
3. Environments: servers needs to a have a specific setting unlike serverless.
4. Timeout: for the serverless there is timeout limit.
5. Scale: serverless provide more scaling for less cost.


## AWS amplify

One of the companies who in serverless is aws. AWS amplify provides a tools that can help the developers to build their own we application without supporting many languages like react and java. The tools that is provided like hosting web applications and manage users and the content of app and many other tools like Authentication, DataStore,Storage etc .. .

## API (GRAPHQL)

In previous using for the database we used to define a schema for the data. so GRAPHQL transform we can use it to define the data schema without only using a specific model and then the library will work as expected.

### creating and Testing the api

There are steps to create the api first running the project then creating new app then selecting a few options and add your schema then push. AS for testing we can try running some queries by running a command. and finally we can update the schema by editing in the code editor and running command then pushing.
