# Graphs

when we talk about the graphs we can say it is a group of nodes and these nodes is connected something called edges and typically it always is more in the graphs because it connects the nodes. 


## Types of Graphs

We can describe the types of graph in many different ways either with directed and undirected or with completed and disconnected graphs.

### Directed VS Undirected graphs

Directed and undirected have the same concept as both have an nodes who is connected to each by the edges. However the only difference between them is that the unidirectional does not move are appoint to any special direction unlike the directed who is the main concept that each node is directed to another node but only once and we can call them Digraph.

### difference between complete,connected, or disconnected 

the other type of the graphs is the one the complete graph that contains nodes who is connected to each other with no missing connection. the other type is the connected who defines a nodes who is at least connected once. And finally we have the disconnected that we may find some nodes who is not connected.

### Cyclic and Acyclic

cyclic is when we have a graph who if we traversed inside it we will end up into another place. On the other, the cyclic who contains a nodes who is looping with each with each other.

We can always represent the graphs either as an adjacency list or adjacency matrix. matrix when we represent them in a matrix or the list with the matrix and these both shows the connections between the nodes.

And also we have graphs who is called weighted graphs that contains edges with numbers.

## Traversing a graph
There are multiple ways to traverse a graph and both like the tree traversals like either by breadth first that uses a queue exactly like the tree however there some graphs who is cyclic and if used exactly the methods with the tree it will loop for an infinite time around itself so the graphs allowed to use the something called visited to point that each node have been visited before will not be visited. and also the nodes who is not connected to any node will not be visited.

As for depth first we will always start from the root node and then using the stack will push and pop to get other nodes and the  and use the visited tag also. The process here is not that different also from the tree,

finally the graphs has many usage for our life like GPS,social media, airline traffic and many other usage for the graphs in our life.
