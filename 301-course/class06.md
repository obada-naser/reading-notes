 ## Pair Programming
 
 
 
### What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
   1. Greater efficiency.
   2. Engaged collaboration.
   3. Learning from fellow students.
   4. Social skills.
   5. Job interview readiness.
   6. Work environment readiness.
 
 ### In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
     In my opinion, the most beneficial reason for me was the work environment readiness, because in the work environment we will meet with different peoples from different cultures and background so we need to be ready to work with them.
 
  How does pair programming work?
   It involves two roles:
     1. Driver: is the one who types and programs with the help of the navigator.
     2. Navigator:he is the one who guides the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.
