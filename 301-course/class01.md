# Introduction to React and Components



## Component-Based Architecture

when we need to solve a huge problem, we need to abstracte and divide the problem into sub-problems, each associated with component partitions. Therefore, we use Component-based architecture to divide the design into individual functional or logical components that represent well-defined communication interfaces containing methods, events, and properties. and here are the advantages Component-oriented software design:

* Reduced time in market and the development cost by reusing existing components.

* Increased reliability with the reuse of the existing components.


### What is a Component?

there are different definitions for the component but in my opinion, the most appropriate one for it is the component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and is intended to interact with other components. There are three different views for the component:

1. Object-oriented view: It is a set of one or more cooperating classes.
2. Conventional view: It is when viewed as a module of program or functional element.
3. Process-related view: it is when the system build from existing components maintained in a library.

### Characteristics of Components:

* **Reusability**
* **Replaceable** 
* **Not context specific**
* **Extensible**
* **Encapsulated**
* **Independent**

### Advantages of components:

There are many advantages for the components and these are:

**1. Ease of deployment :** Because of existance new compatible versions.

**2. Reduced cost :** Because the existance of third-party components allows to spread the cost of development and maintenance.


**3. Reusable :** It means  also you can spread the cost of development and maintenance

**4. Modification of technical complexity :** Complexity through the use of a component container and its services.
**5. Reliability :** system reliability increases.

**6. System maintenance and evolution :** Easy to change and update.

**7. Independent :** Independency and flexible connectivity of components

**9. Ease of development:** Implements well-known interfaces to provide functionality.




## Props and How to Use it in React

There are different ways to understand data flow and manipulation in React other than frameworks therefore at the beginning it is hard to understand props, state, and other concepts. And here we will study some of these concepts.


### What is Props?

As we know react is contained from components that contains the data. However, the components uses props to pass the data. props stands for  properties  and it is used to pass data from one component to another. the direction of data is unidirectional flow(from parent to child)

### How are props used in React?

These are the steps on how to use the props:

1. define an attribute and its value(data).
2. pass it to child component(s) by using Props.
3. render the Props Data.


### What is the flow of props?

We pass arguments to a function, we pass props into a React component and props bring all the necessary data.
Arguments passed to a function.Props can only be passed to components in one-way (parent to child).
Props data is immutable (read-only).


## Things I want to know more about

I want to know how to use the react in a proper way and how it can be more effective than the previous. Also, I want to know how props and components works in examples.
