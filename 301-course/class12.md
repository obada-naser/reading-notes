# SQL vs NoSQL Database

## five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases
SQL                                    |                NoSQL
---------------                        | ----------------------- 
Relational Databases (RDBMS)           | non-relational or distributed database
table-based databases    |      document-based, key-value pairs
predefined schema   | dynamic schema
vertically scalable  |  horizontally scalable
structured query language | Unstructured Query Language

## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

SQL databases are the best fit for heavy-duty transactional type applications, as it is more stable and promises the atomicity as well as the integrity of the data.

## A real-world example

MySQL Community Edition is a very popular open-source database. It is generally been stacked with apache and PHP, although it can be also stacked with Nginx and server-side javascript using Node js.

## What kind of data is a good fit for a NoSQL database?

While you can use NoSQL for transactions purposes, it is not comparable and scalable enough in high load and for complex transactional applications.

## Give a real-world example.

MongoDB: is one of the most popular document-based NoSQL databases as it stores data in JSON-like documents. It is a non-relational database with a dynamic schema.

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL databases are as follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL databases is highly preferred for a large data set

## Which type of database is best for scalability?

In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage the increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add a few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic.
