## Expressions and operators:-

### Operators:- 

* Assignment operators: An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. 
example:

  + Assignment x=y

  + Addition assignment 	x += y

* Comparison operators: compares its operands and returns a logical value like true or false. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values. 
example:

   * Equal (x==y)
     
   * Not equal (x!=y)
    
* Arithmetic operators: an operator who takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value. 
example:
      
  + Remainder (%)
  + Increment (++)

* Bitwise operators: it is an operator who treats its operands as an binary values 
example: And, Or
* Bitwise operators: Used with boolean values and return a boolean value.example:(&&) (||)
