# Functions in JavaScript

## Introduction:-
A function is a block of code designed to perform something either with parameters or without. Thus, it is much the same as a Procedure or Subroutine, in other programming languages.


## Function Declaration:-
Function is declard by using a (function) keyword then a name or anything describe the function, then a  parentheses ().

## Function expressions:-
It is when the function can be defined inside an expression and thus create anonymous functions.

## Function calling:-
The function will be in invoked or called using three methods:-

    1. Self invoked like recursive
    2. An event occured
    3. Invoked by a certain code in JavaScript

## Function benefits:-

 * you can use a certain code as much as you need with only changing the input variables as a parameters to the function.
 * the code is defined only once.

## Example of function:-

 function myFunction(p1, p2) {
```ruby
  return p1 * p2;  
   // The function returns the product of p1 and p2

}
```
