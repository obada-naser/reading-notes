## HTML

### Introduction:-
In order to build any website from zero Html, CSS, and JavaScript must be grasped and understood to a high extent because they are the basis of any website or webpage however complicate it was . the webpage is a document which can be displayed in a web browser like Internet explorer, firefox, and google chrome and website is a webpages linked together. However, the larger the websites uses more advance tools in their sites.

The web server that contains these websites are located at different places in the world and to connect to the host you must connect to the network using DNS.

### The Structure Of The Webpage:-

For any webpage there is Html that we can regard it as the Skelton of any website and build on it how the real website will be used by the users. Html uses a specific tag to structure the site and provide special meaning to the information and these tags often referred as an element. These tags are the basis of an html and to be able to use them we must learn how they works. Usually, there is content inside closing and opening tags and in the opening tags we can use attributes thar needs name and value to specify how the content will be changed.

### Extra Markup:-
Versions of HTML keeps changing according to the increased advanced technologies (the latest version is version 5 that specified in html like this <!DOCTYPE html>) that appears before us so different tags appeared that can be so helpful in building texts:

* Comments in html example:                                
                 <!-- comment goes here -->

* ID  attribute It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page.
example:
                 <p id="pullquote"></p>

* Class attribute: Rather than identifying one element within a document, why not identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page.
example:-
                  <p class="important">               

* block elements:elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. 
exampled:- 
                  <h1>new line</h1>

* div and span elements: used to allow group block-level and inline elements together. 

* iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page â€” and in that window you can see another page.

## JavaScript

### Introduction:-
The benefits of JavaScript is to make the webpage more interactive by accessing and modifying the content and that is done using a specific rules of programming like make the script run when a specific event has occurred such as pressing a button or clicking a link.

### The Basis Of Programming:-
Program is a script and the script is a set of instructions and when we compile the program these instructions will run as a steps and that is how the program will run. Writing a script needs from the programmer to break the script in tasks and then build each task. Building flow charts can be very helpful in building our program.
