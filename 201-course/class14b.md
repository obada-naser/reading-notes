# CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations


## Transforms

CSS3 introduced a new way to position and alter elements like size, position, and change elements and this property called transform. this property comes in two and three-dimension with each of them a property .


### Transform Syntax
the known syntax for the transform propert is this:
```
div {
  -webkit-transform: scale(1.5);
     -moz-transform: scale(1.5);
       -o-transform: scale(1.5);
          transform: scale(1.5);
}

```

### 2D Transforms
Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes or as called horizontal and vertical axes unlike three-dimensional transforms who works on the x,y, and z and here how elements transform on a two dimesional.

* **2D Rotate :** rotate from 0 to 360.
* **2D scale :** allows to scale a value using the transform property  to change the appeared size of an element.
* **2D Translate** It works like relative positioning, pushing, and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document.
* **2D Skew :** The last transform value in the group, skew, is used to distort elements on the horizontal axis, vertical axis, or both. 

### 3D Transforms

3D transforms is a three-dimensional transforms who works on the x,y,and z and has the same properties of 2D Transforms.


## Transitions & Animations

CSS3 also introduced a transition and animation property that allows altering the appearance and behavior of an element by using transition and allow to alter the appearance and behavior of an element into multiple keyframes using the animation property.

### Transitions
to make the transitions property to take a place we need it to change the state of it and change of styles must be identified and that is done by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and pseudo-classes. 

There are four transitions that are related to transition property and these are transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. However, they are not required to get it to work.


### Animations

transitions used to build out visual interactions from one state to another. However, the animation control and add multiple states to the elements and it has it's own properties like Animation Duration, Timing Function, name, and Delay.

## 8 simple CSS3 transitions

CSS3 introduced some cool transition that will blow your mind and it shows how different this version than any version of CSS appeared before. The most outstanding feature of these is that it  only needs a few lines of code to be executed.

1. Fade in
2. Change color
3. Grow & Shrink
4. Rotate elements
5. Square to circle
6. 3D shadow
7. Swing
