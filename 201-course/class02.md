# Basics of HTML, CSS & JS


## Writing A Text in HTML:


When we write a text using Html we need tags to add extra meaning to the text and also to structure our text in a way that can be more understandable like when adding styles using CSS or making it interactive using JavaScript.

### **Structural markup**:
Elements used to describe headings and paragraphs.

**for example:-**

 * **h1...h6**: used to describe that the text is a header.
 * **p**: used to describe that the text inside the tags is a paragraph. 
 * **br**: used to make a new line. 

 ### **Semantic markup**: 
 Elements used not to affect the structure rather than to add extra meaning.
 
 **for example:-**

 * **Strong**: used to indicate that the text is extra important.
 * **blockquote or q**: used for marking up quotations like someone saying something.
 * **abbr**: used for abbreviation and an acronym.
 * **cite or dfn**: used to take cite or define something from a book.
 * **ins and del**: used to delete and add something new beside it.

## Introducing CSS:

CSS used to create rules that specify how the content of an element or more than one element should appear by adding colors and different styles like changing width and height to the image. This is done by making use of ids and classes.

### Types of CSS:
There are three types of how to use CSS with html:-

1. **External CSS** 
2. **Internal CSS**
3. **Inline CSS**

### CSS Selectors:
CSS selectors are patterns used to select the element or elements you want to style.

## Basic JavaScript Instructions
A script is a series of instruction that the PC needs to follow them so that it can compile any written program.

## Variables:
when we write a script we need to store some data and information , and these information comes in different ways such as:
 
 * numbers 
 * booleans true or false
 * Strings like names,numbers,and symbols

 ## Arrays: 
 Array is  a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values. 

 ## Espresssion & Operators:
 operator is a type of expression that it returns a value from two different values.

 ### Decisions and Loops
 Decision making depends on two things. First, evaluate the condition then execute the statement and that could be more understandable by using flow chart. The most operators used in Decision making is comparison, assignment, and logical operators.

 ## IF Statement:
 it is a statement that uses condition and executes if true.

 ## If...else Statement:
 it is also a statement that executes if the condition is true and if false else will be checked and executed if condition is true.

 ## Switch Statement:
 It is same as If and If else but executes in different way than them. Preferred in more longer if else statements and when there is a changing value.
