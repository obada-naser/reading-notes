# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

## Lists


We use lists in HTML when we need to group a set of related items in HTML to structure our website, for example when we need to navigate into different pages inside of it we use an unordered list. 
There are three types of lists in HTML:

1. **Unordered lists:** It is a lists where each item begins with bullets.
It is created using Ul then li with the content inside each of closing li tags.

2. **Ordered lists:** It is a list where each element is numbered either with numbers, letters, or with latin numbers.And is created using ol then li with the content inside each of closing li tags.
3. **Definition lists:** lists used to define a term. It is created using dl then dt with the defined term and dd with the difintion of the term.

## Boxes in CSS

when styling any HTML in CSS, CSS treats every element in HTML as a box and we use different styles in CSS to change it is own dimensions. 

That is done using these styles:

**width & height:** used to determine the dimensions of the box by increasing/decreasing the width and height.

**hidden:** hides extra content.

**scroll:** used to show not showing information and that happens when there is too much information. 

**Border:** boxes have borders and it is used to separate edges of one box from another.

**Margin:** It is the space between the element and another element.

**padding:** it is the space between the content in the box and the border of the element.

**Text aligning:** used to determine where to align the text.

**inline/block:** using the display to change from inline to block or vice versa.

## Arrays
Array is an object that stores a fixed size of values or in other words, it is a collection of variables of the same type.The values are assigned to t he array inside a pair of square brackets.

### Values in array:
We access the values in any array as a numbered list.

### operators:

* Arithmetic operator
* Comparsion operator
* String operator

## Loops
loops are used to execute some code in a repeated manner and that is done by checking condition if it is true it will keep running if false then it will break out from the loop.   JavaScript has three types of loops and they differ in small details.

### for loop:-
for loops typically used in looping through items or a limited number of times, unlike while loop who can loop unlimited times.

### while loop:-
This loop will keep running until the condition becomes false and will continue to run for as long as the condition in the parentheses is true, so it can be used in unlimited time.

### Do while loop:-
The difference between this loop and the while loop is that this loop will check the condition after running the code. therefore, the code could be repeated unlimited times.
